        <h4><span>About Me</span></h4>
        <p>A Detroit native born with a passion for proving naysayers wrong. I moved 800 miles away to Boston, craving a challenge and with the hopes of beginning a career to help break the chains of poverty in my family. I began my Softeware Engineering career at Resilient Coders and joined Houghton Mifflin Harcourt as a Web Applications Developer shortly after. The determination to make a better life for my family, my competitive nature, and passion for learning has led me to sail on a journey to become a great Software Engineer.</p>

                <span class="col-12">November 2018 - present</span>
                <p>My first position at a large company. I gained a lot of insight an experience on the corporate side of software engineering. I had to adjust to all of the meetings and also learned how to work on an agile team. One of my biggest takeaways is learning to communicate with non-technical team members <a href="#">See More</a> </p>

                <span class="col-12">October 2018 - December 2018</span>
                <p>My very first attempt at teaching coding concepts. I worked with a group of 8 kindergarteners, I would help them set their computers up at the beginning of class and rotate between board games and Scratch(MIT) to get them to understand the building blocks of code. Biggest takeaways were patience and creativity when dealing with new people in tech. <a href="#">See More</a> </p>

                <span class="col-12">May 2018 - present</span>
                <p>My first step into software engineering. I gained so much from Resilient Coders from my pratical coding skills to my soft skills, such as learning how to learn. Here is where I proved I had the chops to be a great engineer. I made it through an intense 14 week Full-stack JavaScript course and later became a mentor for all of the following cohorts. Biggest takeaways are learning how I learn and time management.<a href="#">See More</a> </p>
